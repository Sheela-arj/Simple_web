    <h1>Computer Network</h1>
    <p>A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and peripherals. These devices communicate and share resources like files and printers through wired or wireless connections. Networks can be local (LAN) or global (WAN), with the Internet being the largest example. Protocols like TCP/IP govern data exchange, while network topologies define how devices are structured. Security measures like firewalls and encryption protect data during transmission.</p>
